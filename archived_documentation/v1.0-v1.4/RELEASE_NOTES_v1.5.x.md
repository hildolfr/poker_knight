- Fixed minor issues in demo scripts

## Version 1.5.1 (2025-06-02)
### Critical Bug Fixes - Multiprocessing and Import Issues
- **Fixed circular imports** by moving multiprocessing workers to separate module (`core/parallel_workers.py`)
- **Resolved deadlocks** with lazy cache initialization preventing issues during module import
- **Fixed suit format compatibility** - now supports both 'S' and 'â™ ' formats seamlessly
- **Set multiprocessing start method** to 'spawn' for better process safety
- **Reorganized project structure**: 
  - Moved tests to `tests/` directory
  - Moved documentation to `docs/` directory
  - Cleaned up temporary files and debugging utilities
- **Maintained all v1.5.0 features** while restoring stability
