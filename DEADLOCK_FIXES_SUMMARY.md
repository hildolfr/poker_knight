POKER KNIGHT DEADLOCK FIXES SUMMARY
===================================

Fixes Applied:
  - Fixed Unicode encoding in 38 files
  - Fixed imports in 36 test files
  - Created safe cache and solver configurations
  - Created Redis fallback configuration
  - Created NUMA and parallel processing safe configuration
  - Created comprehensive safe test runner

Files Created:
  - safe_test_helpers.py: Safe cache and solver configurations
  - redis_test_config.py: Redis fallback configuration  
  - numa_safe_config.py: NUMA and parallel processing safe settings
  - run_safe_tests.py: Comprehensive safe test runner

Next Steps:
1. Run: python run_safe_tests.py
2. Check individual test logs in deadlock_analysis_results/
3. Gradually re-enable features as issues are resolved

Environment Variables Set:
  - PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 (Unicode handling)
  - POKER_KNIGHT_SAFE_MODE=1 (Safe mode)
  - POKER_KNIGHT_DISABLE_CACHE_WARMING=1 (Disable cache warming)
  - POKER_KNIGHT_DISABLE_NUMA=1 (Disable NUMA)
  - POKER_KNIGHT_DISABLE_REDIS=1 (Disable Redis)

The main issues were:
1. Unicode encoding problems (Windows cp1252 vs UTF-8)
2. Missing Redis server causing connection hangs
3. Import path issues in test files
4. Cache warming/NUMA initialization without proper fallbacks

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while providing safe fallbacks.
