## üéØ What is Poker Knight?

Poker Knight is a specialized Monte Carlo simulation engine built specifically for Texas Hold'em poker analysis. It provides lightning-fast, statistically accurate probability calculations for any poker situation, making it an essential tool for AI poker bot development, training applications, and advanced game analysis.

**What sets Poker Knight apart:** Unlike basic poker calculators, Poker Knight includes advanced tournament features like **ICM (Independent Chip Model) integration**, position-aware equity calculations, sophisticated multi-way pot analysis, and **GPU acceleration** for massive performance gains - features typically found only in professional poker software.

## üöÄ Quick Installation {#installation}

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies)

Install by copying the `poker_knight/` directory to your project:

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poker_knight/          # Copy this entire directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solver.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_code.py
```

**Basic Usage:**
```python
from poker_knight import solve_poker_hand

# Simplest usage - just your hand (assumes 1 opponent, pre-flop)
result = solve_poker_hand(['A‚ô†', 'A‚ô•'])
print(f"Win probability: {result.win_probability:.1%}")

# Analyze pocket aces pre-flop against 2 opponents
result = solve_poker_hand(['A‚ô†', 'A‚ô•'], 2)
print(f"Win probability: {result.win_probability:.1%}")
```

**Complete API Reference:**
The `solve_poker_hand` function accepts the following arguments:

```python
solve_poker_hand(
    hero_hand,              # Required: List of 2 cards (e.g., ['A‚ô†', 'K‚ô•'])
    num_opponents=1,        # Optional: Number of opponents (1-6, default: 1)
    board_cards=None,       # Optional: List of 3-5 board cards (default: None for pre-flop)
    simulation_mode="default",  # Optional: "fast", "default", or "precision"
    hero_position=None,     # Optional: "early", "middle", "late", "button", "sb", "bb"
    stack_sizes=None,       # Optional: List [hero_stack, opp1, opp2, ...] for ICM
    pot_size=None,          # Optional: Current pot size for SPR calculations
    tournament_context=None # Optional: Dict with tournament settings (e.g., {'bubble_factor': 1.3})
)
```

**Note:** You can provide as few arguments as just your hand - `solve_poker_hand(['A‚ô†', 'A‚ô•'])` - which will analyze your hand pre-flop against one opponent using default settings.

**Advanced tournament analysis with ICM:**
```python
result = solve_poker_hand(
    ['K‚ô†', 'Q‚ô†'],                      # Hero hand
    3,                                 # Number of opponents  
    ['A‚ô†', 'J‚ô†', '10‚ô•'],              # Board cards (flop)
    hero_position="button",            # Position-aware equity
    stack_sizes=[15000, 8000, 12000, 6000],  # Stack sizes for ICM
    pot_size=2000,                     # Current pot for SPR calculation
    tournament_context={'bubble_factor': 1.3}  # ICM bubble pressure
)
print(f"Win probability: {result.win_probability:.1%}")
print(f"ICM equity: {result.icm_equity:.1%}")
print(f"Position advantage: {result.position_aware_equity['position_advantage']:.3f}")
```

**Advanced Usage with MonteCarloSolver Class:**
For access to additional optimization features, use the solver class directly:

```python
from poker_knight import MonteCarloSolver

# Create solver instance
solver = MonteCarloSolver()

result = solver.analyze_hand(
    ['A‚ô†', 'A‚ô•'],                      # Hero hand
    2,                                 # Number of opponents
    ['K‚ô†Ô∏è', 'Q‚ô†Ô∏è', 'J‚ô†Ô∏è'],             # Board cards
    simulation_mode="precision",        # Simulation mode
    intelligent_optimization=True,      # Enable auto-optimization
    stack_depth=45.0                   # Stack depth in big blinds for analysis
)

# Access optimization data
if result.optimization_data:
    print(f"Complexity level: {result.optimization_data['complexity_level']}")
    print(f"Optimized simulations: {result.optimization_data['recommended_simulations']}")
    
solver.close()  # Clean up resources
```

## üß™ Quick Test {#quick-test}

## üöÄ GPU Acceleration {#gpu-acceleration}

Poker Knight includes production-ready GPU acceleration for massive performance gains:

**Setup:**
```bash

pip install cupy-cuda11x  # or cupy-cuda12x for CUDA 12

# Enable GPU in config.json
{
  "enable_cuda": true
}
```

**Performance Gains:**
- Small simulations (10K): Use CPU (GPU overhead not worth it)
- Medium simulations (100K): 5-10x faster on GPU
- Large simulations (1M+): 100-1700x faster on GPU

**Automatic GPU Usage:**
```python
# GPU is used automatically when available and enabled
result = solve_poker_hand(['A‚ô†', 'K‚ô†'], 3, simulation_mode="precision")
print(f"GPU used: {result.gpu_used}")  # True if GPU was used
print(f"Backend: {result.backend}")     # 'cuda' or 'cpu'
```

## üìÑ Requirements {#requirements}

- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies for CPU mode (uses only Python standard library)
- For GPU acceleration: NVIDIA GPU + CuPy (`pip install cupy-cuda11x`)
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Multi-core CPU recommended for parallel processing optimization
