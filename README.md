## üéØ What is Poker Knight?

Poker Knight is a specialized Monte Carlo simulation engine built specifically for Texas Hold'em poker analysis. It provides lightning-fast, statistically accurate probability calculations for any poker situation, making it an essential tool for AI poker bot development, training applications, and advanced game analysis.

**What sets Poker Knight apart:** Unlike basic poker calculators, Poker Knight includes advanced tournament features like **ICM (Independent Chip Model) integration**, position-aware equity calculations, and sophisticated multi-way pot analysis - features typically found only in professional poker software.

## ‚ú® Core Capabilities & Technical Innovations

**Advanced Monte Carlo Simulation Engine**
- **Stratified Sampling**: Intelligent variance reduction using board texture analysis and hand strength stratification
- **Importance Sampling**: Weighted simulations focusing on critical decision scenarios
- **Control Variates**: Mathematical variance reduction techniques for faster convergence
- **Adaptive Early Termination**: Intelligent stopping based on statistical confidence intervals
- Supports all game stages: pre-flop, flop, turn, and river analysis with sub-100ms performance

**Tournament-Grade ICM Integration** üèÜ
- **Independent Chip Model (ICM)** calculations for tournament equity analysis
- **Bubble factor adjustments** that automatically modify hand values during bubble play
- **Stack pressure dynamics** - short stack vs big stack ICM considerations
- **Multi-table tournament (MTT) optimization** with automated equity calculations
- Position-aware equity that factors ICM pressure into decision making

**Professional Multi-Way Pot Analysis**
- **Range coordination modeling** - how opponent ranges interact against hero in 3+ way pots
- **Position-based equity adjustments** for early/middle/late/button positions
- **Defense frequency calculations** optimized for multi-opponent scenarios  
- **Bluff-catching frequency optimization** against multiple opponents
- **Coordination effects analysis** - statistical modeling of opponent cooperation

**Sophisticated Hand Evaluation**
- **Unicode card representation** using emoji suits (‚ô†Ô∏è ‚ô•Ô∏è ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô£Ô∏è) for clear visualization
- **Optimized hand ranking system** with pre-computed lookup tables for maximum speed
- **Special case handling** for wheel straights (A-2-3-4-5) and ace-high vs ace-low scenarios
- **Hand category frequency analysis** with statistical confidence reporting

**Real-time Decision Support**
- **Sub-100ms analysis** for live gameplay integration
- **Configurable simulation modes**: Fast (10k sims), Default (100k sims), Precision (500k sims)
- **Parallel processing** using ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound optimization
- **Memory-optimized algorithms** with object reuse and minimal allocation patterns

**Zero-Dependency Architecture**
- Pure Python implementation using only standard library
- **Thread-safe design** for concurrent usage in multi-threaded applications
- **Clean single-function API**: `solve_poker_hand(hole_cards, opponents, board_cards)`
- Seamless integration into existing poker AI systems and applications

## üöÄ Quick Installation {#installation}

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+ (no external dependencies)

Install by copying the `poker_knight/` directory to your project:

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poker_knight/          # Copy this entire directory
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ solver.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_code.py
```

**Basic Usage:**
```python
from poker_knight import solve_poker_hand

# Analyze pocket aces pre-flop against 2 opponents
result = solve_poker_hand(['A‚ô†Ô∏è', 'A‚ô•Ô∏è'], 2)
print(f"Win probability: {result.win_probability:.1%}")

# Advanced tournament analysis with ICM
result = solve_poker_hand(
    ['K‚ô†Ô∏è', 'Q‚ô†Ô∏è'],                    # Hero hand
    3,                                 # Number of opponents  
    ['A‚ô†Ô∏è', 'J‚ô†Ô∏è', '10‚ô•Ô∏è'],            # Board cards (flop)
    hero_position="button",            # Position-aware equity
    stack_sizes=[15000, 8000, 12000, 6000],  # Stack sizes for ICM
    pot_size=2000,                     # Current pot for SPR calculation
    tournament_context={'bubble_factor': 1.3}  # ICM bubble pressure
)
